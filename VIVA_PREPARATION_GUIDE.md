This guide provides detailed suggestions and ideas to help you prepare thoroughly for your viva (oral examination) on the LMS project.

## 1. Understand the Project Architecture
- Explain the overall structure of the LMS project.
- Describe the separation of concerns: frontend, backend, database, and documentation.
- Discuss the role of key directories such as `admin/`, `config/`, `database/`, `docs/`, and `lms-laravel/`.

## 2. Key Functionalities and Features
- Describe the main features: book management, author management, user profiles, borrowing history, special offers, and notifications.
- Explain how users interact with the system (e.g., borrowing books, searching, registration).
- Discuss administrative functionalities and how they are implemented.

## 3. Technologies and Frameworks Used
- PHP as the primary backend language.
- Use of CSS and Bootstrap for styling and responsive design.
- SQL for database management and migrations.
- Mention any Laravel components or customizations if applicable.
- JavaScript for client-side interactivity.

## 4. Database Design and Management

- Configuration management using files in `config/`.
- Backup and recovery procedures.
- Logging and monitoring using files in `logs/`.

## 8. Challenges Faced and Solutions
- Discuss any technical challenges encountered during development.
- Explain how you resolved issues related to database design, performance, or security.
- Share lessons learned and improvements made.

## 9. Future Improvements and Roadmap
- Highlight planned features or enhancements from `ROADMAP.md`.
- Ideas for scaling the application or improving user experience.
