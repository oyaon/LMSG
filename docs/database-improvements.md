# Database Operations Improvements

This document outlines the improvements made to the database operations in the LMS application.

## Overview of Changes

1. **Created Reusable Database Operations**
   - Implemented a [`DatabaseOperations.php`](../includes/DatabaseOperations.php) class with generic methods for CRUD operations
   - Added specialized entity classes for book and author operations
   - Standardized database interaction patterns across the application
2. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Added comprehensive error logging with file and line information
   - Implemented user-friendly error messages
   - Created a flash message system for displaying notifications
   - Added try-catch blocks around database operations
3. **Enhanced Security**
   - Ensured all database queries use prepared statements
   - Added input sanitization for all user-provided data
   - Implemented proper file upload handling with security checks
4. **Added Documentation**
   - Created detailed documentation for database operations
   - Added example files demonstrating usage patterns
   - Documented best practices for database interactions

## File Structure

### New Files
- [`includes/DatabaseOperations.php`](../includes/DatabaseOperations.php) - Generic database operations
- [`includes/BookOperations.php`](../includes/BookOperations.php) - Book-specific operations
- [`includes/Author.php`](../includes/Author.php) - Author-specific operations
- [`examples/database-operations-example.php`](../examples/database-operations-example.php) - Example usage of generic operations
- [`examples/book-operations-example.php`](../examples/book-operations-example.php) - Example usage of book operations
- [`docs/database-operations.md`](database-operations.md) - Documentation for database operations
- [`docs/database-improvements.md`](database-improvements.md) - This file

### Modified Files
- [`includes/init.php`](../includes/init.php) - Updated to include new classes
- [`add_book.php`](../add_book.php) - Updated to use BookOperations class
- [`practice.php`](../practice.php) - Updated to use Author class
- [`all-authors.php`](../all-authors.php) - Updated to use Author class

## Usage Examples

### Generic Database Operations

```php
// Get all records from a table
$authors = $dbOps->getAll('authors', 'name', 'ASC');

// Get a record by ID
$author = $dbOps->getById('authors', 1);

// Insert a new record
$newAuthor = [
    'name' => 'John Doe',
    'biography' => 'A prolific writer...',
    'book_type' => 'Fiction'
];
$newAuthorId = $dbOps->insert('authors', $newAuthor);

// Update a record
$updateData = [
    'biography' => 'Updated biography text.'
];
$result = $dbOps->update('authors', $updateData, 1);

// Delete a record
$result = $dbOps->delete('authors', 1);
```

### Entity-Specific Operations

```php
// Add a new book
$bookData = [
    'name' => 'Example Book',
    'author' => 'Example Author',
    'category' => 'Fiction',
    'description' => 'This is an example book description.',
    'quantity' => 10,
    'price' => 19.99
];
$newBookId = $bookOps->addBook($bookData);

// Get all authors
$authors = $author->getAllAuthors();
```

### Error Handling

```php
try {
    $books = $bookOps->getAllBooks();
} catch (Exception $e) {
    // Log the error and set a flash message
    Helper::handleException($e, true, Helper::getDatabaseErrorMessage('fetch', 'books'));
}

// Display flash message if any
Helper::displayFlashMessage();
```

## Benefits

1. **Code Reusability**
   - Common database operations are centralized in reusable classes
   - Reduces code duplication across the application
   - Makes maintenance easier
2. **Consistent Error Handling**
   - All database errors are handled in a consistent way
   - Detailed error logs help with debugging
   - User-friendly messages improve user experience
3. **Improved Security**
   - Consistent use of prepared statements prevents SQL injection
   - Input sanitization prevents XSS attacks
   - Proper file handling prevents security vulnerabilities
4. **Better Organization**
   - Clear separation of concerns between different types of operations
   - Entity-specific classes handle specialized operations
   - Generic operations are available for simple cases

## Next Steps

1. **Update Remaining Files**
   - Apply the same patterns to other parts of the application
   - Convert direct database queries to use the new classes
2. **Add Unit Tests**
   - Create unit tests for database operations
   - Ensure all error cases are handled properly
3. **Implement Transactions**
   - Use transactions for operations that modify multiple tables
   - Ensure data consistency across the application
